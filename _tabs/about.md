# About Me

Greetings, fellow digital denizens! I'm Toons Loons, a professional script kiddie (just kidding... mostly). I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast who's passionate about poking and prodding at systems until they reveal their deepest, darkest secrets. 

In my spare time (which is basically all the time), I can be found lurking in the shadows of platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box. Here, I hone my skills in the noble art of:

* **Vulnerability Assessment & Exploitation:** Basically, I try to break things on purpose (for educational purposes, of course!). 
* **Network Security:** I decipher the mysterious whispers of network protocols and learn how to keep the bad guys (basically me) out.
* **Cryptography:** I dabble in the arcane arts of encryption and decryption, trying to outsmart those pesky algorithms.
* **Web Application Security:** I hunt for vulnerabilities in websites, hoping to prevent the internet from imploding. (enter dramatic blast sound) 

I'm always learning and growing, because the world of cybersecurity is a never-ending game of cat-and-mouse. I love sharing my knowledge and experiences with the community, and I hope to contribute to a more secure digital world... even if it means occasionally causing a little controlled (most of the time) chaos.
